# react-SearchFilter
### Created with CodeSandbox

### A simple JavaScript app that filters a list of items. The app allows users to filter items by typing in a text box.

To go to the app on Sandbox go to this URL: __[https://codesandbox.io/s/0x9jro761v](https://codesandbox.io/s/0x9jro761v)__

To go to the app on a local browser try this URL:__[https://0x9jro761v.codesandbox.io/](https://0x9jro761v.codesandbox.io/)__


If you click on the github link to sandbox on this repo at: __[https://codesandbox.io/s/github/psharif/react-Search-Filter](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/psharif/react-Search-Filter)__. 

I added a bootstrap resource on mine for the input element so add this bootstrap cdn resource : __[https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css)__

For testing the app I used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). 

All my tests check the validity of different search results. 

I ran 9 in all but more can be added. Feel free to test it out with other possibilities. The tests when the test button on the bottom of the dock is pressed, here's a sample: 



Here's a sample of my app working:
